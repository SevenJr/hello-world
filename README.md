# hello-world
This is my first repository at GitHub.
This is I am learning how to create a new branch and make changes in GitHub.
The new branch is simply a copy of the original one, but it can be different since when we make changes. 
My understanding to this kind of branch framework is that we can keep history versions of every changes.
